	<h1>Brief description of our project</h1>
	<p>Our project is a virtual laser shooting box, modeled after a section of the Science Olympiad Divison C Optics event. The user can use up to 5 mirrors to reflect the laser beam around obstacles in an attempt to reach the target (the green circle). </p>
	<h1>List of Working Features / Things you should test</h1>
	<p>The mirrors are reflecting correctly (the laser should obey the law of reflection when it collides with each mirror). The mirrors also move correctly with the arrow keys when selected and rotate correctly. After the path of the laser has been calculated (shown with a moving red circle), the laser itself is drawn.</p>
	<h1>List of Unresolved Bugs</h1>
	<p>Mirrors can still overlap with each other, which is a minor issue and should not affect the laser itself. After selecting a mirror with the buttons, the user has to press tab until none of the buttons is encircled/highlighted to move the mirror of selection. A similar problem occurs with the "Clear Laser" button. The most important bug is that the box itself may not load or respond, returning a NullPointerException. If this happens, quit the GUI and run again.</p>
	<h1>Directions on how to compile and run your code </h1>
	<p>Please compile and run LaserShoot.java</p>
	<h1>Directions on how to use your program</h1>
	<p>LaserShoot starts out with M1 as the selected default mirror. You can select the other mirrors with buttons along the top of the screen. You can then move the selected mirror with the arrow keys and rotate them with buttons 1-5. The goal is to direct the laser to as close to the target as possible. Have fun!</p>
