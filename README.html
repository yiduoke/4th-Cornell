  <h1>Brief description of your project</h1>
<p>Our project is a virtual laser shoot, a section of the Science Olympiad event Optics. The user can use up to 5 mirrors to reflect the laser beam in an attemp to get it to the target, the green circle. </p>
  <h1>List of Working features / Things I should test</h1>
  <p>The mirrors are reflecting correctly (following the law of reflection), moving correctly with arrow keys when selected, and rotate correctly. After the path of the photon is finished shown, it is drawn out.</p>
  <h1>List of unresolved bugs</h1>
  <p>Did not get around to mirror collision yet.
You have to press tab until none of the buttons is encircled to move the mirror of selection.</p>
    <h1>Directions on how to compile and run your code </h1>
  <p> Please compile and run LaserShoot.java</p>
    <h1>Directions on how to use your program</h1>
  <p>LaserShoot starts out with margaret as the selected default mirror. You can choose the other mirrors with buttons. You can then move the selected mirror with arrow keys. the goal is to direct the laser as close to the target as possible. Have fun!</p>
