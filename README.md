# 4th @ Cornell

Our project is a virtual laser shoot, a section of the Science Olympiad event Optics. The user can use up to 5 mirrors to reflect the laser beam in an attemp to get it to the target, the green circle. 

The mirrors are reflecting correctly (following the law of reflection), moving correctly with arrow keys when selected, and rotate correctly. After the path of the photon is finished shown, it is drawn out.

Did not get around to mirror collision yet.

Please compile and run LaserShoot.java

LaserShoot starts out with margaret as the selected default mirror. You can choose the other mirrors with buttons. You can then move the selected mirror with arrow keys. the goal is to direct the laser as close to the target as possible. Have fun!
