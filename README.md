Our project is a virtual laser shoot, a section of the Science Olympiad event Optics. The user can use up to 5 mirrors to reflect the laser beam in an attemp to get it to the target, the green circle. 

The mirrors are reflecting correctly (following the law of reflection), moving correctly with arrow keys when selected, and rotate correctly. After the path of the photon is finished shown, it is drawn out.
